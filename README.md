# DeepSP
DeepSP is an antibody-specific surrogate model that can generate 30 spatial properties of an antibody solely based on their sequence.

# How to generate descriptors (features) using DeepSP

- Prepare your input file according to the format DeepSP_input.csv
- Run the notebook file DeepSP_predictor.ipynb
- DeepSP structural properties for sequences inputed, would be polulated and saved to a csv file.
